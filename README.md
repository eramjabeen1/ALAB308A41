The Cat Breed Viewer is a responsive web app that allows users to explore a variety of cat breeds using data from TheCatAPI. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses Axios via CDN for API calls and Bootstrap 5 for styling. Users can select a breed, 
view images and detailed information, and even favorite their favorite felines with a simple click. Designed and developed in VS Code with Live Server,
this project focuses on clean, modular code and a smooth user experience, no build tools or frameworks required. A light and interactive way to practice real API
integration and DOM manipulation.
